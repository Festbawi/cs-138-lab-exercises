I remembered earlier that we didn't need PyCharm to run Python, we can just install the normal Python, then use Sublime Text as the editor.

Download:
- python-3.6.4.exe at https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.4/python-3.6.4.exe

Quickest way:
1. Use and submit UDPPingerClient.py (I've modified it, so mine's different)

Longer way:
1. Install Python 3 (python-3.6.4.exe)
2. Open the "UDPPingerServerWithMoreComments.py" file with Sublime Text
3. Read the file, try to understand most of it.
4. Try to run the UDPPingerServer.py (this makes __name__ == '__main__' true):
	a) Open cmd
	b) Navigate to the folder with "cd" command
	c) Type "python UDPPingerServer.py"
5. The server is now on, basically, that's just how we run python files.
6. Make a new file (I suggest Sublime Text)
7. Read UDPPingerClient.py, and compare it to UDPPingerServer.py (UDPPingerServer.py is given by sir)
8. Try to compare them and notice differences. I myself just searched "udp pinger python" on google, and found a very similar UDPPingerServer on the internet, and a corresponding UDPPingerClient, and just modified it to fit sir's version.
9. I'll answer any question you have~
